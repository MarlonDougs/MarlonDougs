## About Me
I'm Marlon Douglas, 25 years old, and I'm transitioning to become a Full Stack developer. My journey into the programming world began last year (2022) with programming logic classes, and since then, I've been striving to balance studies, family, and my current job while learning and growing with every step.

ðŸ’» - Currently, I'm working in the parking industry as a Team Supervisor, where I lead a team of colleagues and handle administrative tasks.

## My Experience
- Parking Supervisor
- Intermediate Excel skills
- Business Management
- Teamwork
- Programming Logic

## My Current Focus
I'm still at the beginning of my career, seeking learning opportunities in the field, and any advice is greatly appreciated.

I'm currently studying Full Stack development at [DIO](https://www.dio.me/) and also AWS Cloud on [DIO](https://www.dio.me/) , thanks to scholarships I received from Santander Bank. I'm also competing for another scholarship to study Back-end.
